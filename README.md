# cracking-the-coding-interview
Python solutions to Cracking the Coding Intereview (6th edition).

This repository is primarily intended to track my progress through the book.

* Code is written for python 3.5
* As I worked through the book, I thought of implementing some methods spoken about, like the permutations of a string, decimal to binary, etc, so I added them to the root of this repository. They aren't used by any problem in particular.
